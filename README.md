# Acumatica Practical Selenium Exercise

The test automation script covers steps 1 to 4 and their respective sub steps, except the verification 3.b and 4.2. The code is yet to be refactored and groomed. The project depends on Oracle Java 1.8, Maven 3.8.5 Windows and having the latest Chrome browser (tested on Version 120.0.6).

To execute the script.

1. clone the reposistory.
2. checkout the feature/acumatica branch.
3. clear the local .m2 repository.
4. navigate to the project and run mvn clean install.
